# Crop-Recommendation-System
A Machine learning based crop recommendation system that predicts the best crops to be grown based on the soil properties and weather conditions.

*Requirements*

The following packages need to be installed to run the system:-
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

*Usage*
1. Download the dataset("Crop_raw_data.csv") and "Crop_Recommendation_System.ipynb" files.

2. Open the Google Colab platform and import the("Crop_raw_data.csv") dataset and "Crop_Recommendation_System.ipynb" file.

3. Run the "Crop_Recommendation_System.ipynb" script by executing each cell.

## Results
- Achieved accurate crop recommendations using Machine Learning models based on soil and environmental conditions.
- Identified key factors such as soil type, pH, rainfall, and temperature influencing crop suitability.
